# Kentico Compose sample .NET MVC web application

This is a sample website written in ASP.NET MVC 5 designed to showcase the functionality of Kentico Compose. It is an enhanced version of the Kentico Cloud sample application. 

* it uses the [Kentico Cloud Delivery .NET SDK](https://github.com/Kentico/delivery-sdk-net) to manage and retrieve content from Kentico Cloud
* it uses [Kentico Cloud Personalization .NET SDK](https://github.com/Kentico/personalization-sdk-net) to track site visits. 
* the views are enhanced with **Editable areas** to allow users to edit pages using the visual interface of Kentico Compose. 
* it contains sample implementations of 2 custom widgets.

More information about Kentico Compose can be found in the [Kentico Compose Demo documentation](https://docs.kentico.com/display/RES/Kentico+Compose+Demo).

## Application setup

We recommend running the sample application in Visual Studio 2013 or later. By default, the application uses the default Kentico Cloud Sample project to serve content.

To run the aplication:

1. Clone the sample application repository.
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio (using the _DancingGoat.sln_ file).
1. Run the application.

The sample application will open in your browser.

## Connect your project

If you already have a Kentico Cloud account, you can connect this sample application to a project of your own to access its unpublished content items, and track visitors on the site. For example, you can connect the application to your version of the Sample project.

1. Select your project in Kentico Cloud.
1. Navigate to the **API keys** section.

    * You will be copying the Project ID and API keys for the Delivery Preview API and Personalization API.

1. Open the `\DancingGoat\Web.config` file.
1. Use the values from your Kentico Cloud project in the `Web.config` file:

    * **Project ID**: Insert your project ID into the `ProjectId` application setting.
    * **Delivery Preview API**: Create a new application setting named `PreviewToken` in the `<appSettings>` section, and use the Delivery Preview API key as its value.
    * **Personalization API**: Create a new application setting named `PersonalizationToken` in the `<appSettings>` section, and use the Personalization API key as its value.

    ```xml
    <appSettings>
        ...
        <add key="ProjectId" value="YOUR_PROJECT_ID" />
        <add key="PreviewToken" value="YOUR_DELIVERY_PREVIEW_API_KEY" />
        <add key="PersonalizationToken" value="YOUR_PERSONALIZATION_API_KEY" />
        ...
    </appSettings>
    ```

1. Save the changes.
1. Run the application.

After you run the application, Kentico Cloud will track site visits and create new contacts when visitors submit a form. You will also be able to see all project content including the unpublished version of content items.
